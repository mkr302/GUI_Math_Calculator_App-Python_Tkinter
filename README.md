#### Package requirements: 
            Tkinter, re

#### Functions available in the calculator: 
            +, -, /, *, %

#### Other Functions in the calculator:
            Delete - deletes the input entered one number/character at a time
            AC - Flushes the entered input from the calculator display
            Ans - Retrieves the last calculated result
            MC - Clears the memory i.e. resets the last calculated result to zero

#### Features in the Application:
            - User Input validation, ignores non-int/non-float inputs
            - Catches the exception of division by zero
            - Allows a series of numbers and operators to be entered as a single input and performs validation as well as calculation
            - Memory to hold last calculated value
